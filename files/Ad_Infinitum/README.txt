This course covered various theories concerning infinity. We talked about Aristotle and his useful distinction between actual and potential infinity, as well as his ideas about continuous vs. discontinuous infinite sets. Later in the semester we covered some of Cantor, set theory, and cardinality. Below are the two papers I completed for the course.

paper_1.pdf:
A paper on the continuity of time, based on Aristotle's arguments and also making reference to Richard Sorabji.

paper_2.pdf:
Another paper on the continuity of time, this time focusing on Hume's discussion in his Treatise of Human Nature.
