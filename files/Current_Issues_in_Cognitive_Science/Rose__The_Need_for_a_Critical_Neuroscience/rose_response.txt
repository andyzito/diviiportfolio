I am particularly interested in one passage in Rose's article that discusses "reductionism." It is a mistake, says Rose, to reduce mind to brain. He would disagree with the claim that "we are our brains." How can we sort out this philosophical mess? It is true that even an epiphenomenal theory of mind must acknowledge that mind and brain are distinguishable, just as "apple" and "redness" are distinguishable. Mind may be a property of the brain, but it is not the exact same entity. We might also think of this in terms of the scope of mind and brain. Brain refers only to the squishy grayish organ residing in the heads of many lifeforms here on Earth. Mind, on the other hand, as a property of brain, refers to an abstract -- consciousness, self-awareness, intelligence, and the like, all bundled into a package under the heading identity or self (or something along those lines, at least). Mind could in theory apply to substrates besides the brain, for example, a computer. Any system which is complex enough could, in theory, "develop" a mind. Of course, these are hypotheticals only, since we so far have no examples of a mind based on anything other than a brain. But hypotheticals can serve as illustrations, and in this case they illustrate the separate nature of "mind" and "brain." Does this mean, then, that we are not our brains? Is there, as Rose seems to suggest, some way in which our brains are like our legs -- simply tools which the "self" uses to walk, or in this case, to think? I am not convinced that this is plausible. Comparisons to properties like color or temperature, are, I think, far too simplistic for this case and cannot help us. If mind is a property of brain it is a property very much more complicated than those which we can easily imagine. But let us consider what it would mean to say that the self is "using" the brain -- can this claim help but imply some form of dualism? Rose says that "I need my brain to think, but it is I, not my brain, which does the thinking." (57) What does it even mean to say that? If we are epiphenomenalists, then we accept that ever thought I have, everything involved with thinking, is somehow represented in the electrochemical signals racing around inside my neural network. In what sense, then, is the brain not the object which does the thinking? In what sense is our "self" not identical to it? Discussions of this nature are difficult because the notion of a self which lives over and above the brain and the body is baked into our very language, but we can't let that get in the way of taking a serious look at Rose's potentiality problematic viewpoint.
