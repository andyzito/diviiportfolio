# Andrew Zito's Division II Portfolio

For those not familiar with the Hampshire College system, Division II corresponds to the middle two years of your undergraduate education. In my case, it actually corresponded to my first year at Hampshire, and my last year at my previous school (Simon's Rock), because I transferred halfway through the four years of undergrad.

This portfolio serves two purposes: to demonstrate my (early) skills as a web developer, and to showcase the work I did during those two years (academic work, that is).
