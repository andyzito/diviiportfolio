# Andrew Zito's Division II Portfolio

For those not familiar with the Hampshire College system, Division II corresponds to the middle two years of your undergraduate education. In my case, it actually corresponded to my first year at Hampshire, and my last year at my previous school (Simon's Rock), because I transferred halfway through the four years of undergrad.

This portfolio serves two purposes: to demonstrate my (early) skills as a web developer, and to showcase the work I did during those two years (academic work, that is).

## Details

The directory structure is fairly self-explanatory. You might be confused by `main.php`, which, you will note, is a bunch of overstuffed arrays of data. This is the content of the eportfolio. In essence, `index.php` contains a bunch of calls to a function that reads each of those data arrays and uses them to produce the sections of the site.

I do not stand by the practicality or efficiency of this method of content management. However, I think it demonstrates what can fairly be called a *creative* solution to the problem of content management (for someone who wanted to do it all themselves, for self-educational purposes).
