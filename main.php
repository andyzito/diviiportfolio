Andy offered comments on some, though not all, of the weekly readings; in general they were quite insightful and thought-provoking.  For the final paper he wrote an intelligent, thoughtful and literate essay addressing some central philosophical and methodological questions about consciousness, particularly the status of conscious experience. Is it the \"kind\" of thing that is open to scientific inquiry? Can its nature be captured in a computational-representational framework? Andy argues that it cannot, pointing to notions like beauty and morality - both of which, however, have been (to some extent) been shown to be amenable to a computational approach, or as products of natural selection that are instantiated (somehow) in neural circuitry and/or neuro-hormonal states.  He also argues quite nicely against a classic dualist approach, asserting that \"Experience exists more like a property than a material, distinct from but not separate from the brain.\" Whether such properties are indeed not at all amenable to scientific investigation, as Andy concludes, remains an unsolved question that I don't think he convincingly answers. Not surprising, as no one has! But his essay is clear, clever and subtle; it's a tad brief but that's  a testimony to the succinctness and force of his writing.  All in all, it was a great pleasure to work and talk with Andy in this seminar."),

He carefully examined the claim that the self-referentiality is a necessary but not sufficient condition for performativity and then proceeded to ask what other necessary conditions there are.

For the first four or five weeks of the course, we will do this as a class and I will give you weekly assignments that give you practice at using what we\'ve learned. The descriptions will form a grammar, and as this grammar is built, I will put it on the website as handouts and lecture notes.<br><br>Once we have gotten past this preliminary stage, the course will be divided between lectures and working on problems. Theere will be a series of “domains,” from which you must choose to specialize in. Those domains are specific topics in syntactic theory, and you will be tasked with becoming an expert on that topic. They are:<br><br>- Head Movement<br>- Argument Movement<br>- Wh Movement<br>- Binding Theory<br><br>The lectures will give a sketch of each of these domains, and then there will be lecture notes on the website that give more in depth information. For each of these domains, there are four problems that increase in difficulty. Your grade depends on how far into these problems you get. Every time you solve a problem, you will turn it in and if the solution holds, you will be allowed to go to the next problem. If it doesn\'t, then you will try again.

They were a mixture of brilliance and carelessness. Lot of "little" mistakes throughout, but nothing substantial. He clearly mastered the core theory.<br><br>For his research proposal, Andy considered two puzzles:<br><br>1. Present Perfect Puzzle, which has to do with the observation that a sentence like "Jack has left yesterday" is not possible in English even though we understand the event of leaving to have taken place in the past when we say "Jack has left".<br><br>2. Imperfective paradox, which has to do with the observation that a sentence like "John was writing a letter" does not entail that John has written a letter, nor that there was some letter that was created.<br><br>Andy did a terrific job explaining where our theory had something to say about the two puzzles above and where it fell short. Andy\'s reflection was also terrific, pointing out the shortcomings of our theory and possible steps to take in the future. Andy could have done more with his analysis of "yesterday" (recognizing that its meaning depends on the context of utterance) and should have been more careful with his logical forms for several key examples.<br><br>If Andy became motivated to do linguistics (or anything else for that matter), he could be a star.

										'body par' => "I don't think of my life as a story. Looking back, I see regrets. I see pain. I see the foundations of who I am, and they don't look too sturdy. So I try to focus forward. I try to pay attention to what I can do now and what I will do next. But that's what conclusion paragraphs are for – right now, you'd probably prefer to read the story that is in my past, however little I acknowledge it.<br><br>My academic journey has been a series of changes of the mind and heart. If we start all the way back in elementary school, you'll see that I spent a lot of time drawing and writing. I wanted to be an author. I didn't just want to be an author – it was my plan to be an author, and a famous one, too. But most elementary schoolers have silly dreams, and maybe that is all mine was as well.<br><br>In middle school and high school, my interest shifted from creativity to history, and from history to philosophy. Here I stayed for a long while, enjoying the intellectual masturbation of thinking about things for the sake of thinking about them, and occasionally worrying about how I would make enough money to live in my future career as a… philosopher?<br><br>Then I got to college and everything changed again. After the first year there I had exhausted almost every philosophy course they had to offer. In the second semester of my second year I decided that I'd had enough of Averroes and Aristotle. I remembered a brief period in my younger years when I had become enthralled with linguistics. My father and I had watched a video lecture on language research in chimpanzees. I thought to myself, \"what better to combine my love of language and thinking than the study of language itself?\"<br><br>So I took introductory linguistics. I also took an introductory coding course because it seemed like a good thing to know. Both of these courses rapidly took over my time. I had been right, I thought, about linguistics; it was both fascinating and practically satisfying in a way philosophy had not been. Language is such an obvious, ingrained factor of our daily lives that we usually take it for granted, not questioning why such a complex system works. Now I was getting to peek behind the curtain and see what most people never even thought about, the machinery behind the magic – and it was exhilarating.<br><br>Computer programming proved a bit more of a surprise. I found myself accidentally spending hours in the Student Union lounge absorbed in lines of Python. Working with code gave me total control of what I was creating. Even better, it gave instant and clear feedback; either it worked or it didn't. This combination proved to be addictive, and I still find myself descending into a problem-solving fugue when presented with interesting coding challenges.<br><br>Thus I changed course once again and vowed to become a computational linguist. This was the field that would allow me to combine my love of linguistic analysis and computer puzzles, right? Unfortunately, my college didn't offer any more courses in either of these fields, so I transferred to Hampshire. It was at this point that realized I only had one year left until I was supposed to start my thesis (or Division III, now), and that I only one class under my belt for each of my declared major fields of interest. During my first semester I began scrambling to catch up – I took two computer science courses with Lee Spector, an advanced linguistics and philosophy of language seminar with Daniel Altshuler, and a cognitive science overview course with Mark Feinstein.<br><br>These courses served as an excellent introduction to Hampshire. I practiced conversational debate in Current Issues in Cognitive science and fleshed out my programming toolbox in Artificial Intelligence and Programming for Science. Most enjoyable was Performative Utterances, which was a penetrating look into one of the more mysterious aspects of language. I also began adjusting to my new surroundings and preparing for the upcoming two years.<br><br>In the next semester, I continued to barrel ahead, and filling in my linguistics background by taking Syntax, Phonology, and Semantics. In these courses I began to see how it was that linguists had created the theories that I was learning. In Semantics and Syntax especially, we spent a lot of time discussing why we were learning the things we were, why the mothers and fathers of these frameworks of understanding had made the choices they made. Over the course of the semester I realized how little I had been exposed to this before, and began to see that truly appreciating a theory requires an awareness of the decisions that affected its genesis.<br><br>The genesis of the theories exists alongside the genesis of the corresponding reality. As we linguists pick apart the weave of natural language, trying to figure out how it is put together, native speakers somehow gather together threads of a thousand different rules and entwine them together into a nearly perfect whole. There are many angles from which to approach the study of this process – but the role which I observed it playing on our linguistic theory was that of a second metric against which to judge our assertions. Not only must our explanations accurately predict the observable facts of language, but they must also make sense in the context of language acquisition.<br><br>Another way we judge our theories is by how universal they are. Everyone seems to be striving to find a single set of rules that can explain all language. Generative phonology is the perfect example, since generative phonologists believe that all languages are just different prioritizations of the same underlying phonological rules. In syntax, we try to make our rules as general as possible. While we could come up with three different rules to fit what seem to be three different situations, it is more optimal to find a way that these three situations are actually governed by one underlying principle.<br><br>These are several of the major themes I took away from those three linguistics courses. Perhaps even more importantly, over the course of that semester, my Division II, and perhaps my entire life, I have come to this realization: I love to create things, and I love to create them well. From drawing syntax trees for homework to cobbling together final projects in Clojure, there is nothing quite like the thrill of satisfaction upon making something that is whole, complete, perfect – or as close as it can be, anyway. I think that for me, the act of creation must be the core of whatever I do, or it will be a most listless journey ahead.<br><br>In that same semester, along with all these other epiphanies, I took a course in my supposed field of interest, Computational Linguistics. This class filled the very important role of demonstrating to me in concrete terms that I in no way, shape, nor form wanted to be an actual computational linguist. Despite its name, modern computational linguistics involves more statistics and mathematics than it does coding or linguistics. This left me with a question – how can I combine my interests if not through actual computational linguistics?<br><br>This all brings us to the here and now, fall of 2016, poised on the edge of Division III; and the point of that very condensed overview of the history of me was to demonstrate why it is that I tend to look askance at my academic foundations. I worry that I have not spent long enough in any one field and that it could be my undoing.<br><br>But I am learning not to ignore my past. Over the past year, and especially in the writing of this essay, I have come to realize that the diversity of my academic path is not a weakness but a strength. Every single thing that I have learned will serve me in some way, and the diverse background that I carry will benefit every endeavor I undertake. I will be able to draw connections others will not. I will be able to see things from multiple perspectives.<br><br>I no longer look at my foundation as a teetering collection of half-built pieces, but as a broad and stable basis from which to launch my further adventures. As I forge ahead at Hampshire, I will use my experience in academic diversification to weld together linguistics and programming into a creation which I hope will bring me the greatest satisfaction of any yet.<br><br>I will not lie and say that I have everything planned out; that I know exactly how I will accomplish this. I cannot offer that kind of guarantee, because, as my history clearly shows, I am and always will be dedicated not to any singular field, but to pursuing the understanding of all things that I find interesting. What I can say with honesty is that I have a burning passion to subdue all knowledge to my command, and a diverse background of skills with which to do so. I plan to use every single one of these skills, and every single piece of knowledge I have gathered on my meandering way here, to create a Division III project that will be truly worthwhile."),

Knowing not much more than this, I met Ajmal Jackson-Brown, and he told me about MyRise.<br><br>Ajmal\'s dream was to break down the barriers that prevent minority groups from gaining a foothold in the world of education, and eventually in the world of professions. In order to do this, he envisioned a pipeline -- give under-priveleged kids the opportunity to learn basic web development skills. This gives them a huge advantage as they finish high school and apply to college. They will have a better chance to go to, and stay in, a good school and get a good education in web development and/or computer science. When they graduate, they will have a wealth of skills and a degree in one of the most desired fields today.<br><br>To create the start of this pipeline, Ajmal created MyRise, a pre-college coding academy targeted at high school juniors and seniors. I helped Ajmal teach the first run-through of MyRise. I began working with him a few weeks after the start of the program, and quickly became enmeshed in the challenges of teaching nine high schoolers how to build websites.<br><br>Throughout the 10-week course of the program, we covered a HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as the various tools necessary to code and maintain a website. At the end of the course we hosted a graduation ceremony where each student received a certificate and a check for $200 - money that came directly from a client that they themselves built a website for.<br><br>I found the experience at times trying and at times exciting. Overall, it was an incredibly rewarding undertaking. I truly grew to love the feeling of breaking through the barrier of understanding with a student, together. That moment when you finally figure out how to help someone understand for loops is a second-hand eureka moment, and is just as good as one you have yourself.<br><br>I am glad that I was able to find a way to contribute to the community, to help people, that allowed me to put to use the knowledge I acquired while studying computer science.')),
